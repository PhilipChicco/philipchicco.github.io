## About 

A PhD candidate and research assistant with an honors MS in computer science looking to further my knowledge of algorithmic design for vision systems tailored for medical image understanding. My career goal is to assume a role which allows me to take responsibility for the analysis and interpretation of medical data for a well-respected University. I am extremely passionate and quick to pick up novel concepts.
