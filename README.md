## Biography 

I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Abdelhamid Mehri Constantine 2 University, El Khroub, Algeria, and Chonbuk National University, Jeonju,
South Korea, in 2015 and 2018, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in robotics and mechatronics engineering from the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), Daegu, South Korea,
in 2023.

I am currently a Research Fellow with the Department of Robotics Engineering, Medical Imaging and Signal Processing Laboratory, DGIST. My research interests include designing algorithms for medical
image analysis (classification, detection and segmentation ..), low-shot learning (few/semi/zero), and visual-language representation learning.
